# zchop

This is a python library providing the function `zchop`, which replaces numbers
that are close to zero with zero. `zchop` traverses structures such as `list`s and
numpy `array`s, returning a copy that is the same as the input except that small numbers
are set to zero.

* The parts of complex numbers are treated separately


* Warning. This is an early, not-debugged version.
